# honeycluster
This GIT contains the code for the article "Towards NLP-based Processing of Honeypot Logs".
The collected sessions are stored in the folder "./Data"; each NLP technique (tfidf, Count Vectorizer and W2V) has its own notebook and saves the resulting files and images on the "./Results" folder. 
Notice that, for each attempt, we're saving:
1) Dendorgram
2) Heatmap
3) Tuning trends for clustering
4) Labeled sessions
5) Labeled parsed sessions

Furthermore, a folder containing the tuned W2V model is also present.
